Objectives:

- determine which factors are associated with birth weight and characterize the relationship between each factor and birth weight
- explore whether fit of a linear regression model is adequate or whether robust regression methods are needed
- estimate the impact of eliminating maternal smoking on birth weight in a population

Interim report (9/7): produce a 5 page (maximum) report using R markdown that clearly describes your process for model selection and validation. Provide clear interpretations of the associations between each predictor and birth weight in laypersonâ€™s language, including characterization of uncertainty. Figures may be included as appropriate. Code should be fully reproducible.
