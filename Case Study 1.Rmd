Objectives:

- determine which factors are associated with birth weight and characterize the relationship between each factor and birth weight
- explore whether fit of a linear regression model is adequate or whether robust regression methods are needed
- estimate the impact of eliminating maternal smoking on birth weight in a population

Interim report (9/7): produce a 5 page (maximum) report using R markdown that clearly describes your process for model selection and validation. Provide clear interpretations of the associations between each predictor and birth weight in laypersonâ€™s language, including characterization of uncertainty. Figures may be included as appropriate. Code should be fully reproducible.

#Data Import and Cleaning

```{r}
#Read in birth data
o_data <- read.csv("Yr1116Birth.csv", 
                   na.strings=c("9","99", "9999"))
#SEX=1 male, 2 female; male=1 male, 0 female
o_data$male=2-o_data$SEX #binary gender for interpretation

birth_data <- na.omit(o_data)

birth_data$GEST_C=birth_data$GEST
birth_data$BWTG_C=birth_data$BWTG
birth_data$GEST_C[birth_data$GEST_C>50]=NA
birth_data$GEST_C[birth_data$GEST_C<20]=NA
birth_data$BWTG_C[birth_data$BWTG_C<500]=NA
bdclean=na.omit(birth_data)
